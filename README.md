# Employee Burnout Analysis

## Overview

The **Employee Burnout Analysis** project aims to analyze the various factors influencing employee burnout in organizations. By leveraging data analytics and visualization, the project uncovers insights into employee well-being, helping businesses identify key patterns that lead to burnout. The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate factors like company type, gender, work-from-home setup, and the number of days since joining the company, all of which could potentially contribute to burnout. This analysis is a crucial step toward developing a predictive model to foresee and mitigate employee burnout in the future.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- **Preprocess** the raw dataset and clean the data.
- **Analyze** relationships between employee attributes and burnout levels.
- **Visualize** trends and patterns to provide actionable insights.
- **Predict** employee burnout (in future work), using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including the following features:
- **Gender**: The gender of the employee.
- **Company Type**: The industry or company type the employee works for (e.g., IT, Healthcare).
- **WFH Setup**: Whether the employee works from home (Yes/No).
- **Burnout Level**: A numeric or categorical value representing the employee's level of burnout.
- **Date of Joining**: The date the employee joined the company.

## Key Features

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing or null values.
   - Encoding categorical variables (such as gender and company type) into numerical values.
   - Creating new features to enhance analysis, such as the number of days an employee has been with the company since joining.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performing an in-depth analysis of the data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
   - Using statistical techniques and data visualization to understand the relationship between burnout levels and other variables.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualizing the data using different plots and graphs (e.g., histograms, correlation heatmaps, and bar charts) to provide an intuitive understanding of employee burnout.
   
### 4. **Burnout Prediction (Future Work)**
   - In future stages of the project, machine learning algorithms will be developed to predict burnout levels based on employee data.
   - Models like linear regression, decision trees, or random forests will be explored to predict burnout accurately.

## Libraries and Tools Used

This project uses the following libraries:
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and preprocessing.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Handling numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for plotting graphs and charts.
- **Scikit-learn**: Future use for machine learning and predictive modeling.


## Process Overview

### Data Preprocessing:
The first step of the project is to clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and performing any necessary transformations. We create a new column representing the number of days since the employee joined the company.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA techniques are applied to understand the distribution of burnout levels, correlations between various features, and to identify outliers or anomalies. Key questions answered during this phase include:
- Do certain company types or industries report higher burnout levels?
- Is there any significant correlation between burnout and factors like gender or work-from-home status?

### Data Visualization:
Data visualization is an important part of this project, as it helps to visually communicate the findings of the EDA. Graphs like heatmaps for correlations, bar plots for categorical features, and histograms for numerical features are created to better understand the data.

## Future Work

The next steps in this project will include:
- **Model Development**: Using machine learning algorithms to predict burnout levels based on employee attributes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Testing and refining the model's accuracy, precision, and performance.
- **Actionable Insights**: Providing insights for organizations to reduce employee burnout based on predictive results.
